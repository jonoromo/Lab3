# Lab3
 
In this lab, we wrote a motor controller class in python that implements closed-loop proportional control. The class utilizes our previous motor driver and encoder reader classes. The motor controller creates a motor driver and encoder object using these classes, and modifies them to produce the control signal. The driving algebra behind our control loop is proportional gain multiplied by the difference between the desired and actual position. The controller class reads the current position from the encoder reader object, and using that information updates the motor driver object with the necessary PWM.

While this algorithim enabled us to effectively control the motor position, we still needed to select an appropriate proportional gain to generate the best motor response. We used our GUI program to extract data from step responses delivered to the motor and saved the results as a JPEG file titled Motor Responses. The graph in the mentioned file contains three responses: an overdamped and slow performance generated by a gain of 0.02, a response with excessive overshoot and oscillation generated by a gain of 2, and a response with the best performance generated by a gain of 0.06.
